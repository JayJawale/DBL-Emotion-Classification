# DBL-Emotion-Classification
Emotion Classification from text conversations using Deep Broad Learning
Existing emotion classification methods such as Bi-LSTMs, RNNs and GRUs adopted to grasp the contextual information in a conversation neglect the relationship between the utterance and the speaker. Thus, the Deep Broad Learning model integrates this information using Broad Learning System to predict better emotional classifications. 

It uses the [MELD](https://affective-meld.github.io/) dataset. 

This implementation is inspired from and based on the algorithm and methodology described in ["Deep Broad Learning for Emotion Classification in Textual Conversations"](https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.26599/TST.2023.9010021#:~:text=Deep%20Broad%20Learning%20for%20Emotion%20Classification%20in%20Textual%20Conversations,-Show%20Author's%20Information&text=Emotion%20classification%20in%20textual%20conversations%20focuses%20on%20classifying%20the%20emotion,language%20processing%20in%20recent%20years.)
